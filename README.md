How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful Degradation is when the product starts at best quality and functionality and then starting going down to lower levels and losing quality. Service workers are used to enhance the product and improve the product in lower levels. In general Graceful Degradation works from the top to down in order to ensure it works for older devices or different unique browsers. While service workers accommodate for products with little internet access. Overall both provide improvement in the product or application to better make the user expierence as good as possible. In one end helps make the product work at full capacity and the other helps work it at its lowest capacity.
